HorSy15k is a fully annotated synthetic dataset designed for training horse/animal pose recognition models. It contains 15,000 synthetic images of horses, each with 20 annotated keypoints and a bounding box (bbox). Even obscured keypoints/joints are annotated.

## Key Features

- **Fully Annotated**: Each horse image in the dataset is annotated with 20 keypoints, providing precise information about the pose of the horse.
- **Obscured Keypoints**: Even when keypoints are obscured they are annotated in HorSy15k.
